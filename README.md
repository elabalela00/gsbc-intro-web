## Biography and Proposal
#Biography
<p>Carmela Moreno was born and raised just east of the Bay Area and will be graduating this semester with a major in music ministries. Music has always been a passion of hers, whether it be playing the piano, arranging and performing specials, or just listening to and appreciating good music. Web programming may be a completely new world for her, but discovering the unfamiliar language and science of it all intrigues her to see what she is capable of creating.</p>
#Vision
<p> My vision is not <i>completely</i> set in stone, but a rough idea still exists. I'd like to create a website that contains accessible information relating to the field of music. It would include simple lessons on various topics concerning the fundamentals of music theory. There could also be exercises or tools to apply the lessons into practice. Overall, the main goal that I would want accomplished would be for others to gain a basic understanding and appreciation of music after visiting this conceptual website.</p>
#Inspiration
<p> The inspiration for this stemmed from https://www.musictheory.net and https://www.musictheoryacademy.com, websites that I've visited countless times for lessons or personal practice. I'd like to model my website after their easy navigation and structured format.</p>
